        <h3>How search works</h3>
        <p>If you try to search with empty search field, system return you
            random images. You'll get new portion of random images on every
            page refresh.</p>

        <p>You can enter one or more tags into search field and system will try
            to find results correspondingly.</p>

        <p>Search engine is strict, it expects you to enter exact tags, no
            spelling mistakes, no similar words. Exact tag or nothing. You can
            browse all existing tags on the tags page.</p>

        <p>You can also specify your query by using + as <strong>and</strong>,
            - as <strong>not</strong> and | as
            <strong>or</strong>. For example <strong>fat cats | small dogs +
                frogs - snakes</strong> will be
            treated as anything with tag "fat cats" or with tag "small dogs",
            obligatory with tag "frogs" and definitely without tag
            "snakes".</p>

        <p>If you're getting strange results and want to ensure that system
            understood your request, you can click on note under search field
            (works only if you're actually searched something).
            This will toggle explanation section with parsed request and timing
            for each operation. This allows you to verity that your request is
            parsed correctly.</p>

        <p>First phrase of a query implicitly gets its keyword.
            You can explicitly specify it by entering something like "+ cats +
            dogs" or "- cats + dogs".</p>

        <div class="explain-query"
             style="display: flex; justify-content: center">

            <span class="explain-query-keyword">or</span>
            <span class="explain-query-word">fat cats</span>

            <span class="explain-query-keyword">or</span>
            <span class="explain-query-word">small dogs</span>

            <span class="explain-query-keyword">and</span>
            <span class="explain-query-word">frogs</span>

            <span class="explain-query-keyword">not</span>
            <span class="explain-query-word">snakes</span>

        </div>

        <p>Each <strong>and</strong> is treated as "result must include this
            tag". More tags you enter, more specific the result will be.</p>

        <p>Each <strong>not</strong> is treated as "result must not include
            this tag". More tags you enter, less results you get.</p>

        <p>When working with <strong>or</strong>, search engine combines all
            records, that have at least one of the given tags. You will see
            difference only entering more than one <strong>or</strong>
            statement, otherwise result will be the same as entering
            <strong>and</strong>.</p>

        <h3>How tags page works</h3>
        <p>Tags page gives you easy access to all available tags, ordered by
            alphabet.</p>
        <p>Number after tag box show how many records are
            using this tag (numbers in this example are arbitrary).
        </p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <ul class="tags-list">
                <li>
                    <p class="tag-header">1</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a class="tag-box"
                       href="{{ url_for('search') + web_query.replace(q='1997')|string|safe }}">1997</a>
                    x 10
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a class="tag-box"
                       href="{{ url_for('search') + web_query.replace(q='1998')|string|safe }}">1998</a>
                    x 20
                </li>

            </ul>

            <ul class="tags-list">
                <li>
                    <p class="tag-header">C</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a class="tag-box"
                       href="{{ url_for('search') + web_query.replace(q='cats')|string|safe }}">cats</a>
                    x 30
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a class="tag-box"
                       href="{{ url_for('search') + web_query.replace(q='cabbage')|string|safe }}">cabbage</a>
                    x 45
                </li>

            </ul>

            <ul class="tags-list">
                <li>
                    <p class="tag-header">D</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a class="tag-box"
                       href="{{ url_for('search') + web_query.replace(q='dogs')|string|safe }}">dogs</a>
                    x 74
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a class="tag-box"
                       href="{{ url_for('search') + web_query.replace(q='dark fantasy')|string|safe }}">dark
                        fantasy</a> x 2 587
                </li>

            </ul>

        </div>

        <h3>How navigation page works</h3>
        <p>
            Navigation page allows you to specify which themes you are
            interested in.</p>
        <p>By clicking on checkboxes you can exclude some themes from search.
            Excluded theme will appear crossed out and will not be used during
            search.</p>

        <p>Additionally this will affect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No materials from theme will appear during random search (when
                there is no user query) and standard search.
            </li>
            <li>Items from excluded theme will not be counted in statistics on
                the tags page.
            </li>
            <li>Tags from excluded theme will not be displayed on the tags
                page.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By clicking on the arrow in the right corner of every theme you can
            get list of all groups in that theme.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beware: you can get strange results clicking on groups in
            excluded themes. Usually you will find nothing. Include theme
            before browsing its groups.
        </p>

        <h3>How feedback page works</h3>
        <p>Feedback page was added so users could mention which material they'd
            like to see on site and also note bugs that should be fixed. You
            can submit any thoughts related to the site, what you liked, what
            not and which materials you see as not appropriate. Don't forget to
            mention your contact address if you want to get response. Usually
            inbox gets checked once a week, so do not expect a fast reply.</p>
